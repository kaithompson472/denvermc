Big news: the Denver MeshCore network is growing fast, and we're excited to share our 2026 expansion plan with you.

Our goal is simple: **blanket the entire Denver metro area with reliable mesh network coverage**. We're deploying solar-powered repeaters on strategic mountain locations to maximize range and connect communities across the Front Range.

## What Are Repeaters?

For those new to mesh networking, repeaters are nodes placed at high elevations that extend the network's range. When your device sends a message, repeaters relay it further than you could reach on your own. Think of them as the backbone of the network. They don't originate messages, but they make sure yours get where they need to go.

## Phase 1: Going Live Week of January 12th

Our first two mountain repeaters will be live the week of January 12, 2026:

- **Lookout Mountain** in Golden
- **Morrison Mountain** in Morrison

### The Hardware

We're deploying [PeakMesh Magnet Climber Solar Nodes](https://www.etsy.com/shop/PeakMesh), purpose-built for outdoor deployments:

- **RAK Wireless module** with ALFA 5dBi omnidirectional antenna
- **Solar powered** with dual Nitecore NL2142LTP cold-weather batteries (4200mAh each)
- **Cold-rated to -40°F**, built to survive Colorado mountain winters
- **Weather-resistant ASA housing** with magnetic and zip-tie mounting
- Running **MeshCore firmware** as dedicated repeaters

### Expected Coverage

Here's a simulation of the coverage area from these two locations:

The overlapping coverage zones will reach:

- Golden, Denver, and Aurora
- Broomfield and Westminster
- Centennial, Parker, and Castle Pines

**Note:** This is a conservative estimate at ~30km radius. Real-world range often exceeds simulations, especially with clear line-of-sight.

## Phase 2: Coming Soon

We're already planning the next wave of deployments:

**Flagstaff Mountain in Boulder** will extend coverage to Boulder County and the northern Front Range, connecting Boulder, Louisville, Lafayette, and Longmont to the network.

**Highlands Hill in Highlands Ranch** will cover the southern suburbs and create redundant paths through the network.

## Phase 3: Downtown Denver

After the mountain repeaters are established, we're planning strategic deployments throughout downtown Denver. These urban nodes will:

- **Expand coverage** for residents, workers, and visitors in the city core
- **Provide emergency backup** so if cell networks go down, mesh keeps working
- **Create a decentralized infrastructure** with no single point of failure

This is resilient communication infrastructure for Denver, built by the community, for the community.

## Get Involved

We're building this network together. Here's how you can participate:

### Join Our Discord (Primary)

The best way to stay connected with the community:

- Get real-time updates on deployments
- Ask questions and get help setting up your node
- Meet other mesh enthusiasts in Colorado

### Get Your Own Node

Ready to join the network? Check out our [Getting Started guide](/start) for hardware recommendations, including the same PeakMesh nodes we use for our repeaters.

### Help Deploy

We're always looking for volunteers to help with installations. If you're comfortable with heights and have time to spare, reach out on Discord.

### Host a Node

Do you have a great location like a tall building, hilltop property, or commercial rooftop? We'd love to talk about hosting a community repeater. The network gets stronger with every node.

The mesh is growing. See you on the network.
