# Denver Network Coverage Update - January 2025

The Denver MeshCore network continues to grow! Here's the latest on our coverage expansion and infrastructure improvements.

## Current Coverage Areas

### Strong Coverage (Reliable 24/7)
- **Downtown Denver** - Multiple overlapping nodes
- **Capitol Hill & Cheesman Park** - Well-established coverage
- **Highland & LoHi** - Strong community participation
- **Golden & Lakewood** - Gateway to mountain networks

### Growing Coverage (Expanding)
- **Aurora** - New nodes coming online weekly
- **Littleton & Englewood** - Community-driven expansion
- **Boulder** - Connecting with Denver metro network
- **Arvada & Westminster** - Key corridor development

### Planned Expansion
- **I-70 Corridor** - Mountain gateway repeaters
- **South Denver** - DTC and Park Meadows areas
- **Fort Collins Link** - Long-range connection project

## Recent Infrastructure Improvements

### New Repeaters Online

**Lookout Mountain Repeater** - Our highest-elevation Denver metro repeater is now operational. This solar-powered node provides coverage across most of Jefferson County and links the mountain communities with Denver.

**DU Campus Node** - University of Denver now hosts a permanent node, improving coverage in south-central Denver.

### Network Reliability

We've upgraded several nodes with:
- Better antennas for extended range
- Solar backup power systems
- Remote monitoring capabilities

## How to Check Coverage

Visit our interactive [network map](/map) to see:
- Real-time node status
- Coverage prediction zones
- Signal strength reports

The map updates every few minutes with the latest network status.

## Help Us Expand

The network grows through community participation. You can help by:

1. **Running a node** at your home or business
2. **Sponsoring a repeater** for underserved areas
3. **Hosting equipment** at high-elevation locations
4. **Spreading the word** in your neighborhood

## Upcoming Milestones

- **February 2025:** I-70 corridor repeater installation
- **Spring 2025:** Boulder-Denver continuous coverage
- **Summer 2025:** Full Front Range integration
