# Building a Solar-Powered MeshCore Repeater

A well-placed solar repeater can extend mesh network coverage across entire mountain valleys. Here's how to build one for Colorado's challenging conditions.

## Why Solar Repeaters?

Remote mountain locations lack power infrastructure but offer incredible line-of-sight coverage. A single repeater on a peak can connect communities separated by miles of terrain.

## Components Needed

### Power System
- **Solar panel:** 10-20W panel (oversized for Colorado's winter days)
- **Battery:** 12V 7-20Ah LiFePO4 (cold-tolerant chemistry)
- **Charge controller:** Basic PWM controller with low-voltage cutoff
- **DC-DC converter:** 12V to 5V for powering the node

### Node Hardware
- **RAK WisBlock** or similar low-power board
- **High-gain antenna:** 5-8dBi omnidirectional or Yagi for directional
- **Weatherproof enclosure:** IP67 rated minimum

### Mounting
- **Mounting pole:** Galvanized steel or aluminum
- **Guy wires:** For exposed ridgeline installations
- **Ground rod:** Lightning protection essential in Colorado

## Power Calculations

Colorado averages 3-4 peak sun hours in winter. For a node drawing 50mA average:

- Daily consumption: 50mA × 24h = 1.2Ah
- Winter generation (15W panel): ~3-4Ah/day
- Battery reserve: 3-5 days minimum

This gives plenty of margin for cloudy periods and snow coverage.

## Installation Tips

### Site Selection
- Choose locations with clear line-of-sight to target areas
- Avoid areas prone to heavy snow accumulation
- Consider accessibility for maintenance

### Weatherproofing
- Use silicone-filled cable glands for all wire entries
- Orient enclosure to minimize sun exposure
- Allow for thermal expansion in mounting

### Testing
- Monitor remotely for the first month
- Check battery levels during winter storms
- Verify coverage matches predictions

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Monthly:** Remote status check
- **Quarterly:** Physical inspection if accessible
- **Annually:** Battery health check, antenna inspection
