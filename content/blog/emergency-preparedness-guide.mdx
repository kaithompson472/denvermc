# Emergency Preparedness with MeshCore

When cellular networks fail during emergencies, mesh networks keep communities connected. Here's how to prepare using MeshCore for Colorado's unique hazards.

## Why Mesh Networks Matter in Emergencies

During major disasters, traditional communication often fails:

- **Cellular towers** lose power or become overloaded
- **Landlines** can be physically damaged
- **Internet** depends on functioning infrastructure

MeshCore operates independently, requiring only battery power and line-of-sight between nodes.

## Colorado Emergency Scenarios

### Wildfire Evacuation

Colorado's wildfire season demands reliable communication. MeshCore helps by:

- Providing communication when cell towers are threatened
- Enabling neighbor-to-neighbor coordination
- Sharing real-time evacuation information

### Winter Storm Power Outages

Extended power outages from winter storms are common along the Front Range. Prepare by:

- Keeping charged backup batteries for your node
- Having a solar panel for extended outages
- Pre-establishing communication channels with neighbors

### Mountain Community Isolation

Mountain communities can become isolated during severe weather. Mesh networks provide:

- Emergency communication with outside help
- Coordination among isolated residents
- Status updates when roads are impassable

## Building Your Emergency Kit

### Essential Equipment
- MeshCore device with charged battery
- Solar panel or hand-crank charger
- Weatherproof case for outdoor use
- Written list of emergency channel information

### Recommended Additions
- Backup device for redundancy
- Extended-range antenna
- Paper map marked with node locations
- Emergency contact list for mesh network

## Community Coordination

The Denver MeshCore network is stronger when coordinated:

- **Register your node** on our [map](/map) for emergency responders
- **Join local channels** specific to your neighborhood
- **Participate in drills** to test emergency procedures
- **Share coverage** with neighbors who may need it

## Practice Before You Need It

The time to learn mesh networking isn't during an emergency. Practice now:

1. Set up your device and join the network
2. Send test messages to verify connectivity
3. Know your range and identify dead spots
4. Coordinate with neighbors to fill coverage gaps
