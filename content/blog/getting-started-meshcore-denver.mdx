# Getting Started with MeshCore in Denver

Welcome to the Denver MeshCore community! Whether you're interested in off-grid communication, emergency preparedness, or just want to explore decentralized networking, this guide will help you get connected.

## What is MeshCore?

MeshCore is a LoRa-based mesh networking protocol that enables long-range, low-power communication without relying on cellular networks or internet infrastructure. Unlike traditional radio systems, mesh networks automatically relay messages through multiple nodes, extending range and reliability.

## Choosing Your First Device

For Denver beginners, we recommend starting with one of these options:

- **Heltec V3** - Affordable entry point with built-in display
- **LilyGo T-Deck** - Keyboard and display for standalone use
- **RAK WisBlock** - Modular design for custom builds

Most new members start with the Heltec V3 due to its balance of price and features.

## Basic Setup Steps

1. **Flash the firmware** - Download MeshCore firmware from the official repository
2. **Configure your node** - Set your node name and preferences
3. **Join a channel** - Connect to Denver's public channel
4. **Find a mesh buddy** - Reach out on our Discord to connect

## Denver Network Coverage

Our network currently covers most of the Denver metro area, with strong coverage in:
